#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main () {

    int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    cout << "We have initiated an array with no specified number of elements." <<endl;

    
}

// this way we can make arrays in c++ without specifying the size of the array for example int a[9]; the compiler is smart enough to understand the size of the array and number of elements to be inserted without us spefcifying it's size.
